## Scope of Product
The Data & Analysis Center (DAC) has recognized the substantial amount of time it takes to perform tasks such as performing passive scanning and enumeration techniques, in order to analyze and identify possible vulnerabilities in the systems undergoing testing. This process however can take at times several hours if not days to complete, thus taking away valuable time that could be spent conducting analysis or testing.
 (SEA) seeks to use selected scanning and enumeration tools and report back to the analysts in a useful and timely manner, as well as export data and run automaticallyu after settings have been confirmed and the execution has started.
